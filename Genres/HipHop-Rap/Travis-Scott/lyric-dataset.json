      "Travis can we start off with uh what the name of your album is and what the hell it means cause when I saw it I was deeply confused\nMy albums called Birds in The Trap Sing McKnight\nAnd Imma keep it short for this explanation\nBut, its basically its you know\nAnybody creative thats kind of like been stuck and had a problem getting the idea out, it took me 8 months just to get the 90210 video out, with Hype Williams\nIt took me six months just to get the action figure out\nIt shouldnt take no one, no artist that long, you know\nJust to you know get something idea out\nEspecially something thats going to culturally shift\nYou know, the world musically\nNow the musics more towards the independent artists\nI feel like in a couple years\nWe all be able to fly around and do what we want\n But Why Sings McKnight?\nCause, I wanted Andre 3000 with the whole album\nI had this play idea, Act I, Act II, Act III\nAnd then later on I was like\nWith the visuals I can make it more of a play\nBut theres no way I can make a album out of a play\nIm too much of a rager for this shit to be like \nFor Stuff, for stuff to be to that you know\nI didnt want people to overthink it\nI didnt want it to look too much so I feel like the\nOnly thing that needed to be complicated was my title\nPeople to understand it, and the music straight forward\nAnd thats exactly what it is you could have a party to this album and just let the whole album play\n What do you want to listen to?\nI want to start with the ends thats my favorite song even if you skippin around you gotta start there\nTravis Scotts taking over the show\nIts Travis Scott in the morning\nIts Travis Scott its HOT 97 in the morning\nWait why do you get to talk\nIts Travis Scott in the morning, let him say it\nIts Travis Scott in the morning\nHot 97, Ebro, Rosenberg, Laura Styles lets get it\nEbro I dont know if you realize this\nTheres probably a pretty good chance, knowing Hot 97\nIt will be Travis Scott in here at some point and Ill still be sitting in the same seat, its a pretty good chance\nI think what happens is they bump you out and keep me, in a order thats the order of operation\nWait, Travis out of all the young artists, you are on what, your third project now, you were one of the artists I gravitated to first just cause I can understand what youre saying\nIm just figuring out Young Thug, like I was late to it, but the style of music that youre creating who, who were you inspirations, who did you pattern yourself after, youre 24 now?\nI looked up to M.I.A. and Kid Cudi man hes really one of the main dudes I kinda looked at and listened to all the time\nHe saved my life\nHe saved me from doing random bad things to myself\nKept me focused like..\nJust through his music or personal relationship\nJust through his music because I didnt meet him til\nThe first time I met Kanye was the first time I ever met him\nBut I didnt really meet no Cudi until like earlier like\nLate late late last year when he came by the studio one time just to like talk to me\nWhat was it about Cudis music that spoke to you so much?\nI feel like he really dialed in on like, the youth and really dialed in on like, inspiration, how to inspire you\nHis words were very selected, on like what to do\nI feel like he always made the soundtrack to my life\nOr anybodys life who was like going through the same thing\nIf you a big Cudi fan you know exactly what Im sayin like, he says the exact same things you growing up with\nBut makes it sound way cooler\nI went through this, I went through that\nMy mom didnt have this, we had to go through this\nYou know we had to go through Christmas to do this\nBut the beats and everything just sounded like\nYou know, the Nutcracker\nDo you think, do you think\nAnd you were saying off the air too\nDo you think he gets credit for being a cultural influence?\nNah not at all cause I think, you know\nCudi should be like a top tier artist up there man alongside\nWith these other artists who like, are number one, you know\nI think he fathered a lot of, a lot of the music\nA lot of style of music\nWell, we know what he did for Kanye for sure, like\nEverybody talks about that\nHes a good influence and you know, a good help\nHis writing and his mind\nHe makes beats I dont think people know that\nHe made Sky Might Fall you know, he made mad beats\nHe made some beats on 808s and heartbreak, hes super dope he can write\nSpeaking of which, who did the beats on this album, on your record\nVinylz, I always work with Wondagurl on every album\nCant do a album without her\nTM, this kid named dax, Murda, Cardo\nIts weird though, I only have 4 producers or something like that 4-5 producers\nYou wrote with and worked with Rihanna\nYou wrote with and worked with Kanye West on several things\nSome other artists, I dont want to run through the whole thing But what else are you doing besides writing your verses\nWell when I first came into the game I made beats\nThats what I did, I had to give people my own beats\nAs a artist I lost a lot of lot of lot of time to make beats\nI wanted to focus on raps because I felt like when I came up here I wasnt the best rapper, I had the best beats\nI was doing Cruel Summer, I worked on Yeezus\nWith those albums, like by the I got to Jay Z albums\nI was already having ill songs, so it just turned into me just giving people my songs, you know\nOn Ye album or her album, so on\nI sat and worked with them on the whole album\nWhether it was for two or three months, picking mad beats\nWhether its different people beats or, taking out the drums\nPutting my drums\nHow do you know how to like craft something for someone else\nI always see it, Ima tell yall something about myself\nI was always making music\n You were mimicking other stash\nMimicking other artists, when I was 13-14 years old\nMaking beats and making music just to get the sound, right\nAnd so like, I think every producer, any young producer\nSo like when they make like their favorite rapper\nMade that beat, make the same rap just to understand okay this how they did it\n To Understand\nJust to understand it completely, okay the breakdown\nSo when I grew up, I was like you gotta translate it to your own songs, so that kinda grew me up like welded me\nIm a big fan of people man, a lotta people feel themselves\nThats

      "Travi$ Scott: No Fear\nBeware of Travi$ Scott, rap’s new radical\nFor about the millionth time, a car rockets off a cliff and lands in the water below, but no one really says anything about it. Travi$ Scott, a lanky, 21-year-old rapper and producer from Houston, is renting a room at New York’s Hudson Hotel with a bunch of childhood friends, many of whom now live in the city but currently seem to be enjoying a stay-cation, sitting on the couch, smoking an endless stream of blunts in between cautious swigs from a bottle of Jameson. The crew is laconically, borderline disinterestedly playing Grand Theft Auto V. Scott beat the game a few times already, but there’s something wrong with it and it won’t save, so they’re just messing around, playing through the early parts, exploring the game’s eerie topographical accuracy before launching cars off precipices and into buildings at random, then tossing the controller to the next person on the small couch.\nThe light is dim but warm and Scott is in the other corner of the room, hunched in an office chair, staring into the glow of a laptop and twiddling his stubby braids, which caterpillar off his head and stop short of his temples. It’s a chaotic space, but he’s so zoned out that he barely notices his friends’ endless run of suicide missions.\nInstead, he’s trying to find the right drum sound for his remix of King Krule’s dubby “Neptune Estate.” The pairing, initially, seems a bit weird. King Krule is the recording alias of Archy Marshall, a 19-year-old British singer/songwriter with an old soul and a voice that sounds like it’s been dragged through cigarette ashes and a couple sludgy pints of beer. Scott, for his part, makes music that plays out like the soundtrack to a bunch of Transformers fighting each other in a post-apocalyptic desert landscape, with towering synths jockeying for position against drums that sound big enough to eat the whole world. Still, both artists thrive in a musical environment that allows them to seem like the only people left on earth; it’s like they’re linked by a bombastic caricature of loneliness, Scott with his wide-open expanses and Marshall with his drizzly London streets.\nRight now, Scott’s zeroed in on a drum loop that sounds like it’s submerged in cotton and a couple snatches of a verse, which he’s mumbling into the microphone, barely saying words, grasping at a cadence and flow that’ll match the vibe of King Krule’s original. As Scott gets more confident, his voice gets louder, his words clarify and his subtle Houston drawl gets more pronounced. His friends, who haven’t really been paying attention to what he’s doing, get quiet, or at least quieter. When Scott gets stumped about which words come next, he asks, “Did I write this on somebody else’s phone?” Phones are passed around, and eventually, he finds it. The “writing” is actually a voice recording from sometime earlier. He listens to the blown-out fragment a couple times, then hunches over the mic like he’s focusing on a school test: Stumbled out my hotel late…voice receding to a mumble again…knocking on my mama’s door, she couldn’t tell I wasn’t sober. He’s speaking even lower now, but it’s clear that he’s found what he was looking for. He stops, proudly letting out a “WHOOOOO.” All of this seems to happen in a matter of minutes, which suggests that Scott is both sure of himself and the kind of artist who is always turning ideas over in his head, thinking about the music he’s going to make even when he’s not making it.Recently, Scott’s been on a roll. In 2012, he spent time in Hawaii and New York, working on the Kanye West-helmed G.O.O.D. Music posse album, Cruel Summer; 2013 brought him to Paris, once again working with West on the now-notorious, whirlwind Yeezus sessions. His conversations are peppered with anecdotes about meetings with major record executives, and he’s brimming with stories about hanging out with West. He’s excitedly told multiple interviewers one that involves West getting a Taco Bell Doritos Loco taco delivered to his studio on a Hermes plate.\nBefore that, Scott spent a large part of his early adult life shunting around the country in search of his own career, taking label meetings that went nowhere and were often canceled or pushed back even as he was flying to them. Today, he seems poised on the brink of success, securing, with the help of his manager Anthony Kilhoffer , a spot at three tables in the hip-hop powerhouse—a deal with Epic, plus affiliations with West’s G.O.O.D. Music crew and T.I.’s Warner imprint Grand Hustle. But it took a move from Houston to New York, then Houston again, then New York again, and now, for the time being, Los Angeles, to get there. “I just like the vibe,” he says of LA, like he’s thinking about it for the first time. He’ll later recite the whole list of back-and-forth moves wearily, virtually counting off locations on his fingers as though each held thousands of miniature success stories and close calls with personal failure.\nListening to Scott talk about his early days as an artist, it’s clear that his talent was there, but his direction was not. In high school, he rapped over other rappers’ instrumentals but that didn’t feel quite right, so he started making his own beats. “I used to call myself a producer, but I was an engineer,” he says. “I used to record my friends, and I thought that was being a producer. Then I saw that ’Ye video where he had the yellow Polo and I figured out…Damn, that’s what that is? I gotta make beats.”\n“My vision was being ahead of what’s going on—like two, three years ahead.”\nScott’s childhood home in Houston, where his mother worked at AT&T as an Apple liason and his dad ran his own advertising business, soon became a revolving door for friends and randoms from school who wanted to record. “I was always in a group,” he says, speaking of his early projects. “I feel like my shit was tainted because either somebody’s voice wasn’t right or I was sounding corny as fuck,” he says. “I was in a group with another rapper. This nigga was like my best friend. I had a vision and he had a reality. Those are two different things. My vision was being ahead of what’s going on—like two, three years ahead. He was living in the reality, hanging out with niggas he would think was his friend. It was the downfall of everything. You gotta learn how to completely not fuck with people. That’s a hard thing to do. Just keep walking. Trusting your own vision.” Some of those projects, including TravisxJason, a duo he was part of with a rapper named O.G. Chess until they had a falling out in 2011, can still be found with some creative googling. Their full-length, Cruis’n USA, is promising, largely inoffensive and miles away from the darker terrain Scott would soon inhabit with Owl Pharaoh, his biggest artistic statement to date.\nThat mixtape, released last spring, is a joyfully dark collection of maximalist, wheezing tracks that lumber under their own weight, gears grinding to push out laconic future music hatched from Houston’s long lineage of screwed-down songs that evoke codeine and candy paint and drowsy psychedelia, but imbued with Texas’ lonely flatland and Scott’s husky, often deadpan voice. Scott’s been on a Robert Rodriguez kick lately. At one point, mid-sentence, he pauses to look at the TV, where a trailer for the director’s Machete Kills comes on. Scott points at the screen. “That’s why I gotta work with this guy,” he says, as the actor Danny Trejo, stone-faced, stalks across a burnt yellow desert landscape in slow motion.Scott’s sound is ambitious, but it isn’t exactly experimental. Instead, he’s working in the anything-goes mold already supplied by numerous artists before him: West’s towering artistic statements, T.I.’s elastic voice, the Neptunes’ digital experimentation. Like any kid that grew up in the internet era, Scott has absorbed everything around him, blended it together and come out with a style that is a product of all music everywhere existing on the same plane. Nothing is off-limits when you have access to everything. And with that access, Scott is dead-set on mastering every art form he takes on. “I was always about doing both,” he says of rapping and producing. “I wanted to learn. I wanted to know how to do it. That was my biggest thing about everything. I wanted to know how to use everything. That’s why I do videos. I know how to work a camera, edit a video. I just want to know. I don’t like someone knowing more than me.” His music is an appropriately cinematic reflection of his open mind and keen ear, blending iconic phrases from other people’s radio hits with a production style that evokes every regional rap trope, from New York’s claustrophobically heavy drums to LA’s slow-rolling funk, without sounding like much of an imitation of any of them.\nThe first time you hear his voice on “Uptown,” a highlight from Owl Pharaoh, he sounds pretty much like how you’d imagine the devil to sound. Over grating, hyper-compressed strings, his multi-layered voice grunts, I’m riding up uptown/ WHOO! I’m a motherfucking monster/ WHOO! One hand on the wheel one hand on my dick. Then his words start speeding up, finally colliding into each other in a manic fit: At the green light I’m speeding/ Fourth wheel on, I’m weaving/ I got red eyes...swag seizures. The motherfucking monster line is a callback to West’s “Monster,” but here Scott sounds like he’s living up to the impossible claim. He sounds inhuman.\nEven in his day-to-day life, Scott has the energy of a hyperactive teenager. He works constantly—often in hotel rooms or random studios scattered all over the world—but he’s rarely alone, and, if he’s not making music, he’s always in motion. He climbs on things, wrestles his friends, knocks over lukewarm water into a pile of Swisher shards, tosses his shoes into corners and then kicks them into other corners. He wanders New York with the familiarity and complicated emotions of a former resident. At one point, he scores a pair of green BAPE sandals that are basically modified Birkenstocks, and he wears them everywhere the very next day. Later, at the boutique clothing store Surface to Air, he tries on a sweatshirt, but his friends deem it too small, so he sits down on a bench, hits his G-Pen and puts one of them in a headlock.\n- “Travi$ is not here to make number one rap songs. Those people get high off of making number one songs. I’m into making number one fucking albums.” -It’s this surplus of nervous energy that makes Scott such a compelling performer. Live, he makes every stage seem like it’s actually a trampoline. He is never not jumping, flailing, pacing, climbing rafters, screaming his voice raw. There’s a video of a performance at New York’s club S.O.B.’s last summer where, just over three minutes into his set, he already has his shirt off, the room is pitch black, the crowd is chanting along with him and it looks more like a hardcore show than a typically discerning, not-impressed-by-anything, dead-eyed New York rap crowd. In interviews, though, Scott is all over the place, half-finishing thoughts, going on hilarious tangents that take him miles from his original point. But his enthusiasm skews these moments as charming, not embarrassing. When he talks about his long-delayed first meeting with West at the Jungle City recording studios in Manhattan in 2012, while working on Cruel Summer, his story is a mess of clipped sentences that dead-end even as they get more enthusiastic:\n“ Kilhoffer, my manager, has known ’Ye for X amount…I didn’t even see ’Ye for like four weeks. I was like, What the fuck? This is kind of weird. I was in some studio around the corner. I added shit in on ‘Theraflu’ and that was it, and that was when I met Lifted for the first time—that was the dude that did the ‘Mercy’ beat. I got hit up like, Yo, we want you to fuck with this ‘Mercy’ track. I fucked with it and turned it in. It came out and I was like, Oh shit! That’s the first time I heard some of my sounds. So time goes on and I didn’t meet ’Ye yet, and I was like, Man, that’s weird. So I get back to Jungle City and they’re like, Yeah, he wants to meet you around five. And I didn’t see this nigga for three days. I did the ‘Don’t Like’ remix—the drums and shit. Chop lost the files for the track, so man…Then I met him. I played him what Owl Pharaoh was at the time and he was like, Whoa, and I was like, I got these ideas, and I was singing on it, and we just kept talking…”\nScott is clearly working in the shadow of West, not only in the tone and cadence of his rapping, but also in his disinterest in participating in a traditional path to fame. Success for Scott doesn’t mean being the most visible, or making the most hits. It means having a clear vision of what he wants to do. “I feel like I’m the opposite of the system—I’m the opposite of what Mike WiLL is,” he says. “You will not be able to compare me to a Mike WiLL or to a Young Chop or any of these niggas that make number one rap songs. Travi$ is not here to make number one rap songs. Those people get high off of making number one songs. I’m into making number one fucking albums. Extended long projects that are consistent. That system is the A&R calls you, like, Oh I need a beat for this nigga’s album, for so-and-so’s album, like a Mariah Carey.”\nScott’s belief in the emotional power of the album format isn’t just willful ignorance of the music industry he’s part of, though. He saw a disconnect between what labels wanted and what he was looking for, and decided to follow his own instincts so that he wouldn’t be manipulated by an out-of-touch industry. “Niggas was going mad platinum because they couldn’t download music for free,” he says. “That’s what labels gotta realize. It wasn’t just because you was the best motherfucker alive, because y’all the best label. It’s just because niggas couldn’t access the internet fast enough. Now niggas is smarter than you. It’s like the fat white man sitting in the chair, like, Ah, yes, we got these motherfuckers, they can’t get this shit for free. This is the only way you can buy it. You cannot be commercial no more. You must be real.”Apparently, realness is synonymous with fearlessness for Scott, because during the numerous photo shoots he participates in for this story, he inexplicably finds himself in insanely high places. At one point, he’s crouched precariously on the corner of the roof of a photography studio in the Flatiron District, a coat hanging from his body like a high-fashion version of Batman’s cape. His face is partially obscured by the fabric, Phantom of the Opera-style, but his grill—which he is currently stretching his mouth wide to show off—is glinting in the remnants of the evening sun.\nNot 24 hours later, he’s on the top floor of a very tall construction site. The building is still unfinished, so everyone is wearing hard hats and ugly neon vests. The floor is littered with construction equipment and massive metal girders. Scott’s surrounded by exposed concrete foundation that’ll eventually be covered up. Right now though, people are taking pleasure in writing their names and the date all over the wall, anxious to be an invisible part of the city’s history. Scott wants to do this too, so, Sharpie in hand, he scoots himself up some wiggly plywood that’s angled against the wall and writes his name in blocky letters on the grey surface, shading in parts of the T after he’s done writing it all out as big as he possibly can. The marker is thin, so it’s not really visible unless you get up close, but he works meticulously anyway. A couple times Scott slips back down the plywood, but he wedges his feet, grips the pen and gets back to work. Pretty soon, all this will be covered. Probably no one except some construction workers will see his name here, but he’s leaving his mark anyway, exactly how he wants it.",

      "Now, I’m lost, Jacques Berman Webster II, most definitely lost\nI see the needle sway and they tell me I’m all I got. This is my name, so, this is who I must be, I should listen. This is just an intro to myself, that much is clear. And if I can go get away from myself, I might find something worth bringing back home, but my problem is that my mind is moving at max speed. The air is moving slower the faster my feet move. My Air Max 270s keep me grounded to this hypothetical floor. I’m hovering at the layer between what’s real and what I made up, which are the same being that much I know. And I should be lost on purpose, intention, made it across the universe like perfect, made you wish rehearsed it because it really does look so perfect. My imagination is a burden that has me lost and uncertain, but what nourishes me is Houston. What’s the difference between being lost and escaping? An attention. What’s the difference between a ladder and an elevator? Labor. Feel free to feel lost, it’s free, there’s no cost. The cacti fell over on the path, that’s how I noticed I can fly. The truth is, your always home. I create a city with no buildings or people, just deep breaths and daydreams, nightmares and ancestors’ energies fly and memory. I can get away, I can make it, whether it’s outdated and I’m Jaded, or I become the air and I made it. It maxed out our system like I twisted the mission and made the decision to be free or like other people who can’t see it, they call it, they say I’m lost now. When I laugh my breath mixes with clouds and causes a storm, because I’m not lost, I escaped. Keep your feet where you stand, everything else has escaped",
