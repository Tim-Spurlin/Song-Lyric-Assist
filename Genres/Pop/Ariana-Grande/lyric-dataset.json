      "When will people stop being offended by women showing skin / expressing sexuality? Men take their shirts off / express their sexuality onstage, in videos, on Instagram, anywhere they want to… All. The. Time. The double standard is so boring and exhausting. With all due respect, i think its time you get your head out of your ass. Women can love their bodies too!!\n– responding to a commenter who said she was like a whore in her Dangerous Woman video, on Facebook\nThe incredible double standard that we face on a daily basis, in the industry and just in the world, its shocking. I would be so amused, and pardon me if this comes across as sexist, but I dont think a male artist would be in this position right now. Sorry. If im speaking about something that Im passionate about, Im willing to take the brunt for fighting in what I believe in and my fellow women are definitely something that I will always be one of the first to speak up about.\nIs this what you think girls have trouble choosing between? … Is this men assuming that thats what girls would have to choose between? … You need a little brushing up on equality over here.\nI have a long list of things Id like to change … I think, judgement in general. Intolerance, meanness, double standards, misogyny, racism, sexism. You know, all that shit. Theres lots weve got to get started on. Thats what we need to focus on. Weve got work to do.\n– responding to the question If you could use makeup or your phone one last time, what would you pick? on Californias Power 106 FM\nIm tired of needing to be linked to a guy, Im not Big Seans ex, Im not Nialls new possible girl. Im Ariana Grande.\n– to The Sun\nWhat I meant when I said what I said about not being Seans ex is that I am tired of living in world where women are mostly referred to as a mans past, present or future PROPERTY / POSSESSION. I … do not. Belong. To Anyone. But myself. And neither do you … I cant wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who theyre dating/ married/ attached to, having sex with / seen with … but by their value as an individual. \n are so ignorant sometimes. Stop trying to make people feel badly about their bodies. Its okay to be different ... to be curvy or to be thin. When did it become socially acceptable to comment on what you think is wrong with other peoples bodies? We were having fun! Dancing on stage. Whats she shaking tho??? Im shaking my pretty, cute, petite ass next to Nickis pretty big booty. Both are f---ing awesome. How about we respect peoples body boundaries and encourage each other to feel like a babe no matter how they are? That be nice. So tired of watching everyone try to tear each other down.\n– on Instagram\nGloria Steinem published an article in 1969 titled After Black Power, Womens Liberation and 46 years later … were still not quite there yet! If a woman has lots of sex … shes a slut. If a man has sex … HES. A. STUD. A BOSSSSSS. A KING. If a woman even talks about sex openly … she is shamed! But if a man talks or RAPS freely about all the women hes had … he is regaled. If a woman is seen with a friend with a penis, there is immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled!!! If a man is seen with a woman his status is elevated/celebrated.\n– on Twitter",

      "The first line of Focus is: I know what I came to do and that aint gonna change. What I came here to do in this world is not only to entertain but to love, to share, to listen, to improve, to learn, to share music, to share experience, to share feelings, to make people feel happy and empowered, she explained.\nTo make people feel like theyre not alone. Without using my voice to do those things I would feel empty, she continued. When I say focus on me Im not asking to be the center of attention. Im not asking you to focus on my face or my clothes or my body or my singing voice. By focus on me, I literally mean focus on me. Focus on what Im all about and what I believe in.\nThe more we focus on each other as people and not on what we look like, what were wearing, our gender, our hairstyle, our sexuality, the color of our skin. But focus on each other on a soul level. The more we realize how much we have in common, the more we listen to each other, the more one we become.\nThe title of Aris track might seem like an effort to get people to focus on the right things about her, too, since shes had such a tumultuous year , but she insists this is about all of us.\nYou judge because you dont focus on me, you dont focus on each other, she explained. You judge because you focus on appearance, on clothes. You focus on what you want from me, what you want from people. How you want them to wear their hair. You judge me, you wanna see me dressed a certain way, how you wanna see their make-up, their eyebrows. You focus on what you think people should be like for you. But when you stop and you actually focus on someone, youll see the light in them. When you focus on me, you see the light in me. When we focus on each other, we see the light in each other. And even if you dont, this is who we are. What are we making fun of? Whats there to make fun of? We should apologize for that.",

      "So the news is out about Sam & Cat. I felt it wasn’t my place to make any sort of announcement so I kept quiet until now. I want to thank Nickelodeon for making a childhood dream of mine come true, for being a family to me, for being so accommodating and supportive of my multitasking with my music career, and for of course introducing me to many of my fans however many years ago. I want to thank Dan Schneider for allowing me to play such a special, beautiful character who I hid behind for so long. What I mean by that is when I was younger, people loved Cat so much I used to pretend to be more like her. It took me a long time to be brave enough to separate myself and show people how different we actually are…. I think that’s honestly because I admire her so much. Her appreciation for life and everybody she encounters. Her passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread like school projects and work. She always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good\nI will always hold Cat near and dear to my heart and appreciate her help in my personal growth from teenager to adult. I know she seems like a simple, daft character but she played such a huge part in my life I just wanted to express my appreciation for her and share some of the things I love most about her. I think a lot of people could take a page out of her book…… she wouldn’t judge anybody by their appearance…. she believed the best in people…. she wasn’t afraid of anything or anybody…. she never let people’s judgements hold her back from doing what she wanted, acting how she wanted, dressing how she wanted wanted, dying her hair however she wanted… she never held back her enthusiasm or joy for fear of appearing some sort of way or for fear of jinxing the good that is real \nOne of my favorite things about Cat was that she never lost her sense of wonder. As we grow up we become more and more jaded and fearful of how we come across. We hold back a little more, protect ourselves a little more and although Cat goes through the same ridicule as anybody else does growing up, she never changed or lost her childlike wonder. To me that’s the bravest, most special thing about her. She actually reminds me a lot of Frankie in that way\nSo I know a lot of people will think this is a lot for some ‘dumb’ kids show character . . . . but to me she is actually a lot smarter, stronger and braver than all the rest of us\nHopefully we’ll find out one day if Cat & Robbie ever got married. If I had any say in the story from here on out I’d make sure they were happily married with sweet, eccentric, Jewish, artificially red headed babies. Cat would constantly find herself reminding Aunt Sam to leave the butter sock and other dangerous weapons out of the house. They’d live down the street from Jade and Beck, also happily married with purple and black haired, pale, grungy, beautiful, goth babies. :)\nThank you to the cast and crew who I spent almost every day with for a good 4 or 5 years. Thanks for lighting us beautifully, shooting us beautifully, making the most incredible props, yelling at us when we were running late to set, keeping us on track and most of all for making it such a positive work environment. The guys behind the scenes couldn’t have been more pleasant or hard working and I appreciate them for that so much. I can’t imagine that there is a more pleasant or professional crew in Hollywood\nThank you from the bottom of my heart to a true friend of mine, Dan Schneider. I will never take these memories or lessons learned for granted\nLastly, thank you to my fans who have been with me since all of this started… you are the most loyal, dedicated and continuously loving supporters I could ever imagine. We’ve been through so much and you are still here… and we’ve got a long way to go. :) Thank you for believing in me, accepting me and loving me. I love you forever",

      "The “micromanaging workhorse” finally achieved her dream of becoming an R&B diva. Now, at 21, comes the hard part: conquering her fear of futuristic pop.\nAriana Grande is easily mistaken for an old-school good girl. The singer wears Audrey Hepburn-style strapless gowns, travels everywhere with her mother and trades lovey-dovey messages with on-again, off-again boyfriend Jai Brooks over Instagram. Last year, she implored fans to boycott SeaWorld after the damning documentary Blackfish came out.\nI think people see me as a little cutesy thing, she says, looking, in fact, demure and adorable, seated with her feet tucked underneath her on a giant leather couch. But I’m literally the most sardonic person you’ve ever met.\nProud oddball Iggy Azalea -- Grande’s collaborator on Problem, the song-of-the-summer contender that has elevated Grande to superstar status -- allows that Grande, while very sweet, is definitely quirky. Last year, bloggers simply had her pegged as a mini-Mariah for the lush, unabashedly ’90s R&B sound of her debut Yours Truly, which went to No. 1.\nOn Aug. 25, Grande presents her follow-up, My Everything, and three huge singles released in the run-up to the album have already redefined her as a state-of-the-art pop diva: Besides Problem, a super-catchy, not-at-all-smooth, kiss-off track, there’s the Ibiza-ready Break Free and the woman-power anthem, Bang Bang, with Nicki Minaj and Jessie J.\nGrande, who now lives in Los Angeles, says she was a very weird little girl growing up in Boca Raton, Fla.: Dark and deranged. I always wanted to have skeleton face paint on or be wearing a Freddy Krueger mask, and I would carry a hockey stick around. I was like a mini-Helena Bonham Carter.\nSitting in the cavelike lounge we’ve retreated to in downtown L.A., she looses a throaty, almost maniacal laugh. For my fifth birthday party we had a Jaws theme and all my friends left crying. I mean, I still am that way. But when I was little it was more concerning. There was a stage, when I was 3 or 4, where my mom thought I might grow up to be a serial killer.\nInstead, Grande embarked on a show-tunes-inspired career. She started acting in community theater a few years after the creepy birthday party, and by freshman year in high school, she auditioned and scored her first casting in a Broadway show, 13. That led to a supporting role on Nickelodeon’s teen musical sitcom Victorious and a starring part in the Victorious spinoff, Sam & Cat.\nRepublic Records chairman/CEO Monte Lipman signed Grande when she was 17 and little-known beyond Nickelodeon, after a friend excitedly sent him YouTube videos of her covering Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. Sam & Cat only lasted one season; the final episode aired in July, amid much drama. But two weeks later, Break Free placed No. 1 on iTunes.\nMaking a hit record was always the goal. I remember when I first came to L.A. to meet with my managers, I was like, I want to make an R&B album,  recalls Grande. They were like -- she drops her voice a few registers -- Um, that’s a helluva goal! Who is going to buy a 14-year-old’s R&B album?!\nGrande’s restless ambition is accompanied by a twitchy energy: She’s hummingbird-tiny at just five feet tall, often walking with a stutter step thanks to her giant high heels.\nShe makes dramatic arm gestures as she talks, with the words tumbling out of her mouth. I am hypoglycemic so sometimes I’ll get anxious if I forget to eat, says Grande. When I was a little girl, I would turn into the Tasmanian devil.\nBecause she is a perfectionist, the one thing I’ll say to her every now and again is, ‘Ari, perfect is not always about being perfect -- it’s those flaws that people can relate to,says Lipman. I don’t want you to get to the point where you’re gritting your teeth and your fists are all balled up.\nGrande agrees. I’m a micromanaging workhorse, she says, nodding vigorously. Absolutely an obsessive-compulsive workaholic.\nEven as an 8-year-old kid playing Annie, she didn’t want to stop working. I just wanted to do every single show, she remembers. However many there were in a year, I was in every one, whether I was a chorus girl or the lead or doing the lighting.\nAt that time, Grande’s older half brother Frankie claimed star status in the family. My brother was always the one in the spotlight and I liked that, she explains. It was like he was the entertainment for me.\nGrande’s mother is Joan Grande, who runs a telephone and alarm system company and moved with Ariana’s father from New York to Florida when she was pregnant with their daughter.\nGrande’s father, Edward Butera, owns a successful graphic design firm in Boca Raton. My brother and my mom and my grandparents were always there, she recalls. And my dad, until my parents split up when I was 8 or 9.\nThe week I spoke with Grande was a rough one. Her beloved grandfather had just passed away at the age of 90, and she was posting photos of him -- as a dashing young man in a fedora; on his deathbed, Grande smiling by his side -- in online tributes. Like everything else, Grande shares her grief with her fans. In person, though, she struggles to articulate it.\nIt’s just so fresh and I’m still mourning, she says in a whisper. I don’t even know what I would say to be able to encompass what an amazing man he was. She wipes her forefinger delicately under each eye and smiles. I mean, how much time do you have?\nWhile in Florida caring for her grand­father, Grande met up with her dad, whom she hadn’t seen in a while. It was good, she says. I love my dad. But she’s made no secret of the fact that her parents’ divorce and relationship with her father have been tricky. Everybody with divorced parents knows what it’s like to be in the middle. Even years later I’m still in the middle.\nGrande responded, in part, by cultivating interests from her grandparents.\nI have an obsession with all things vintage and classic and old-school, everything from Marlene Dietrich to Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons to Connie Francis, she says. My grandpa was always telling me I should sing songs from the Great American Songbook.\nBut her most towering influence may be Madonna. After hearing Grande easily harmonize to Madonna albums all afternoon, I half joke that the two should do a song together.\nOh my God, my heart would stop, she gushes. She is strength, she is freedom, she is wisdom beyond anybody’s comprehension. Grande was raised Catholic but departed from that and started practicing my own things when I was around 12 years old, she says. Now, like Madonna, Grande practices Kabbalah.\nAs a fellow Kabbalist, I know how hard it is to exercise those tools in your everyday life, says Grande. Especially in a world where everything is so egocentric and all you do is talk about yourself and promote yourself.\nOf course, Grande has had to be a tireless self-promoter -- even after making it onto TV, she was posting homemade videos online. Her pleasures now are simple, even sparse: The most relaxing thing to me is going to the beach at night, she says. I mostly do it in Boca. She’ll rehearse with her dancers, even when there’s no event coming up, for the company.\nAnd sometimes she’ll fly out her best friend Alexa Paige, a pal from Florida now in college, for fun. But she’s closest with her mother, who she calls fierce, and her brother. They’ll play Heads Up! when a few free minutes open up. Frankie being away on Big Brother is excruciating, because I have no communication with him, and he’s missed so many things.\nThe afternoon we spend together, Grande is surrounded by functionaries, but instead of a combination assistant-slash-best friend, it’s Joan who makes sure to bring her two bottles of water -- one cold, one at room temperature.\nGrande’s also remarkably good at keeping her own counsel. When she sent me The Way featuring Mac Miller, Lipman recalls, referring to Grande’s first big single, she goes, I just made a record that is a smash. When Lipman asked to start planning the video, she said it was already done. \nThat video, which cost virtually nothing, is the only video we ever made for that song, says Lipman. It’s got 100 million views, and at the end of the day, that was her.\nIn scaling up her sound for My Everything, Grande needed to sacrifice control. Everything that I was terrified to try and was absolutely positive I would hate, I tried, she says, explaining that at first she was intimidated by Problem and wary of recording straight-up dance tracks.\nIt’s not like, because Ariana has a huge range, she can only do that kind of music,” says her Break Free co-writer Anton Zaslavski, aka Zedd.\nGrande wasn’t so sure. I hated it at first, she says, describing her vocals on Break Free, which she sings ahead of the beat. Co-producer Max Martin convinced her to sing in what she calls a more forward placement.\nI was like no, no, no! Please just let me sing it how I would sing it, she mock-whines. But he was like, Just try it. Trust me. She loved the results. I was so pleased when I tried something that I thought -- no, that I knew I would hate.\nProblem was also a difficult sell. I loved the idea of it, but the chorus, the whisper was so shocking to me, says Grande, referring to the unexpected, intimate refrain sung by Big Sean -- I got one less problem without you -- which co-writer Savan Kotecha first dreamed up in an airplane bathroom, and completed for Grande after he was brought in to work on My Everything.\nIn the main part, she wanted to show off more of her range -- her normal, I’m-not-screaming voice. But what makes an Ariana song an Ariana song is that it’s a song no one else can sing, says Kotecha. She’s probably one of, if not the best, technical singers of her generation.\nWhen I was 14, I wanted to make a straight-up, like, India Arie record, remembers Grande, laughing. Something really soulful. Is it her inner Bonham Carter that pulls Grande toward what she calls the bittersweetness of soul music?\nMaybe, she says, sighing. I honestly think it could be a past-life thing. You know those things where you love something but you don’t know why, or you’re scared of something but you don’t know why? I feel like all of those things are from another life.\nObviously there’s more to Grande than a shrill, tightly wound diva in training -- Election’s Tracy Flick with a four-octave range. She displays a thoughtfulness and a weirdly sane-seeming mysticism that suggest true depth.\nBalancing real life as a person and unreal life as a famous person is a big part of what Grande works on these days.\nI never thought it would be a thing for me to go out in my pajamas, she says.\nDoes she feel pressure to hide aspects of her private life? I do and sometimes I don’t. I vacillate between saying, I need to keep some things private and I should be able to be myself, and I need to share what I love and everything with the world!\nGrande’s also hard at work planning live shows to support the new album. I did a tiny tour, but it was very small and intimate and on not much of a stage,” says Grande of the shows she played last year, opening up for Justin Bieber.\nIt’s new, very new. It’s going to be a big shock for me. Here’s the thing, she says, leaning forward and speaking in a conspiratorial whisper.\nI have to launch this album, and I get to do a tour, which all sounds fine and dandy...but I just love being in the studio. I could start a new album right now, tonight. That sounds the most enticing to me. I love it.",
      "IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR, Ariana Grande had the number-one, number-two, and number-three songs in America. So extreme a choke hold of the Billboard charts had only one antecedent: the Beatles achieved it in 1964, when “Can’t Buy Me Love,” “Twist and Shout,” and “Do You Want to Know a Secret” blanketed the airwaves. But the singer, whose fame does not so much polarize as it sorts—into those who adore her, ape her high ponytail, and have made her the second-most-followed person on Instagram, behind the Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, and those for whom she barely registers —was in quiet knots. Thank U, Next, the album she wrote and recorded in a two-week fever dream the previous October, contained the most wrenchingly personal songs in her canon, and she was about to embark on a tour of at least 40 cities, where night after night she had to sing her way through a succession of private horrors.\n“I was researching healing and PTSD and talking to therapists, and everyone was like, ‘You need a routine, a schedule,’ ” Grande says, yanking off a pair of black, ultra-high platform ankle boots so that she can crisscross her legs on the sofa and sit close. The boots, by the way, are Sergio Rossi, though we have to dig into the insole to determine this; Grande knows about music, she says, and not about clothes. “Of course because I’m an extremist, I’m like, OK, I’ll go on tour! But it’s hard to sing songs that are about wounds that are so fresh. It’s fun, it’s pop music, and I’m not trying to make it sound like anything that it’s not, but these songs to me really do represent some heavy shit.”\nWe are sitting in the home studio of Tommy Brown, Grande’s close friend and a producer on Thank U, Next, at the end of a noiseless cul-de-sac in Northridge, in the San Fernando Valley. A layer of cloud casts a dull light over the low-lying suburban houses and their front yards dotted with iceberg roses and pepper trees. Grande’s fans, known as Arianators, rivaling the Beyhive and the Little Monsters as the most dedicated and attuned in music, know that she loves the dour weather, hates the beach of her cosseted Floridian youth. “I’m like, please bring me the cold and the clammy and the clouds,” she says. “You want what you didn’t grow up getting.”\nAlthough she has a home of her own in Beverly Hills, the kind of vast, marble-paved manse that young stars buy before they’re ready for them, Tommy’s is where she likes spending time when she’s in Los Angeles. Grande is wearing black leggings and an oversize sweatshirt emblazoned with the words SOCIAL HOUSE, the name of a pop duo from Pittsburgh who are friends and now one of her opening acts. A large white pearl, her birthstone, glimmers on her finger. It occurs to me that we’re talking about the weather for precisely the reason that people talk about the weather, in order to dance around the “heavy shit.” It’s a dance that spins out quickly. Grande begins to cry nine minutes into our conversation, at the mention of Coachella, which she headlined this year for the first time. Following a bumbling interchange of apologies—“I’m so sorry I’m crying,” “I’m so sorry I made you cry”—she explains that the festival offered near-constant reminders of the rapper Mac Miller , her dear friend, collaborator, and ex-boyfriend, who died of an accidental overdose in September 2018. I imagined we would visit this and other delicate topics somewhere deep in our discussion, but grief creates a conversational black hole, drawing all particles to it. “I never thought I’d even go to Coachella,” she explains. “I was always a person who never went to festivals and never went out and had fun like that. But the first time I went was to see Malcolm perform, and it was such an incredible experience. I went the second year as well, and I associate...heavily...it was just kind of a mindfuck, processing how much has happened in such a brief period.”\nFor a woman who recently turned 26 and is enjoying the most successful chapter of her career, it has also been a spectacularly, and publicly, brutal couple of years. Fifteen months before Miller’s death, in May 2017, Grande had just finished the encore of a sold-out show on her Dangerous Woman tour in Manchester, England, when a suicide bomber detonated in the foyer, leaving 23 people dead, including an eight-year-old concertgoer. Shell-shocked and reeling, Grande and her mother, who was in the audience that night, flew home to Florida. But she quickly determined that before she was going to sing anywhere again, she needed to sing in Manchester. She returned two weeks later to visit survivors in hospitals and families in mourning. And she staged a benefit concert that raised $25 million. Guest stars included Coldplay, Katy Perry, and Justin Bieber, and Grande cruised the stage belting out her dirtiest songs at the request of one victim’s mother after it was suggested that the bomber, who had links to the Islamic State, had acted in protest of her racy pop persona.\nBut it was Grande’s culminating rendition of “Over the Rainbow,” intoned through her sobs, that is the night’s eternal image. If you didn’t know Ari, as her friends call her, if you sorted into that other group and assumed that Grande was a lab-engineered Frankensinger, a sexy cyborg extruding melismas in baby doll dresses and kitten ears, here may have been the first piece of evidence to the contrary. “Ariana’s an open book,” says her friend Miley Cyrus, who flew over for the concert. “She has always shared her experiences with this beautiful blend of reality and the fantasy that pop culture requires. But holding her in my arms that night and feeling her shake from the loss of lives, literally feeling her heart pounding against mine—when you can let down the personas and cry with the rest of the world, it’s unifying. It’s a reminder that music can be our greatest healer.”\nShe released no original music until the following spring, when “No Tears Left to Cry,” the first single off her fourth studio album, Sweetener, offered up a dance-floor hymn to optimism in the face of catastrophe. But in November 2018, after Miller’s death and the dissolution of her brief engagement to the Saturday Night Live comic Pete Davidson, Grande had to acknowledge that she was far from cried out, and she did so in a now-famous tweet: “remember when i was like hey i have no tears left to cry and the universe was like HAAAAAAAAA bitch u thought.”\nThese words, classic darkly humorous and self-deprecating Grande, are about as far as she has been willing to go toward addressing the events of the last two years. “I’ve been open in my art and open in my DMs and my conversations with my fans directly, and I want to be there for them, so I share things that I think they’ll find comfort in knowing that I go through as well,” she explains. “But also there are a lot of things that I swallow on a daily basis that I don’t want to share with them, because they’re mine. But they know that. They can literally see it in my eyes. They know when I’m disconnected, when I’m happy, when I’m tired. It’s this weird thing we have. We’re like fucking E.T. and Elliott.” Grande admits to approaching our conversation with a mix of dread and guilt about her dread. “I’m a person who’s been through a lot and doesn’t know what to say about any of it to myself, let alone the world. I see myself onstage as this perfectly polished, great-at-my-job entertainer, and then in situations like this I’m just this little basket-case puddle of figuring it out.” She laughs through her sniffles. “I have to be the luckiest girl in the world, and the unluckiest, for sure. I’m walking this fine line between healing myself and not letting the things that I’ve gone through be picked at before I’m ready, and also celebrating the beautiful things that have happened in my life and not feeling scared that they’ll be taken away from me because trauma tells me that they will be, you know what I mean?”\nGRANDE GREW UP IN Boca Raton, Florida, in a gated community of expensive and lushly planted Mediterranean-style homes. Her mother, Joan Grande, Brooklyn-born and Barnard-educated, owns a business selling marine communications equipment; her father, Edward Butera, is a graphic designer. The couple divorced when Grande was eight. Ariana grew up in character, in a household that relished characters. The theme of her third birthday party was Jaws. She loved to run around the house in a Jason mask, and at Halloween, Joan liked to buy animal organs and leave them floating in dishes. “My family is eccentric and weird and loud and Italian,” Grande says. “There was always this fascination with the macabre. My mom is goth. Her whole wardrobe is modeled after Cersei Lannister’s. I’m not kidding. I’m like, ‘Mom, why are you wearing epaulets? It’s Thanksgiving.’ ”\nGrande declared herself early. Joan recalls a car ride when Ariana was around three and a half; NSYNC was playing, and over and over the little girl perfectly matched JC Chasez’s high notes. There was a karaoke machine at home, and everyone—Ariana, her older half-brother, Frankie, and her mother—was always singing. “The soundtrack was Whitney, Madonna, Mariah, Celine, Barbra,” she recalls. “All the divas. Gay, divas, divas, gay, belting divas.” Joan also played a lot of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, and the family watched old musicals, especially the Judy Garland–Mickey Rooney pictures. “She was so intrigued by how pristine and precise these women were,” Joan recalls. “She studied them carefully.” When the family loved a show, they could be obsessive; Joan estimates that they saw Jersey Boys on Broadway close to 60 times.\nGrande has a preternatural gift for impersonating other singers and actresses—a talent that has made her a surprise darling of the nighttime-television circuit. Grande credits her healthy vocal technique to having learned to mimic Celine Dion, in particular, whose seamless blending through her registers and careful vocal placement have given her greater durability than many of her peers. “I learned how to make it sound like I was belting and being loud without actually belting and being loud,” Grande explains. “The voice is expensive, and if you’re spending it properly, you’ll be able to keep spending it.” When I tell her that I’m surprised by her interest in Judy Garland—not an obvious source of inspiration for a pop artist born nearly 25 years after her death—she cradles her arms in a manner that immediately brings the legend to mind. “I would stand in front of the TV and mimic her body movements. I was always fascinated. She carried herself in a way that was so protected and soft and Judy.”\nAfter years of local children’s theater, Grande landed a role in the Broadway musical 13. Weeks after the musical closed, she was cast as the goofy sidekick Cat Valentine on the Nickelodeon show Victorious, which made her a star with the tween set. “I never really saw myself as an actress,” she says, “but when I started talking about wanting to make R&B music at 14, they were like, ‘What the fuck would you sing about? This is never going to work. You should audition for some TV shows and build yourself a platform and get yourself out there, because you’re funny and cute and you should do that until you’re old enough to make the music you want to make.’ So I did that. I booked that TV show, and then I was like, OK, now can I make music?” While Victorious marched on, in her free time Grande liked to upload YouTube videos of herself singing covers of Adele, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey. It was a virtuoso rendition of Carey’s “Emotions,” which Grande posted in August 2012, when she was 19, that made her a hot property. Since then she has worked at a frantic pace, turning out five albums in six years, all of them certified platinum, and touring the world three times.\nIf one aspect of Grande’s career has been immune to critique, it’s her singing. Patti LaBelle came to know her several years ago, when Grande asked the R&B icon to perform at her birthday party. They have become friends. “She’s surpassed her peers,” LaBelle says. “And she does everything herself, which is not always the way with the young baby girls. She doesn’t need any machines. She’s a baby who’s able to sing like an older black woman.” LaBelle, whose four-year-old granddaughter, Gia, wears an Ariana ponytail, recalls the time when both singers performed for the Obamas at the Women of Soul concert at the White House. Grande was extremely nervous. “I said, ‘Girl, you’re a beast. Go up there and sing like that white-black woman you are.’ Ariana can sing me under the table—and listen, I can sing.”\nGrande’s personal style has left her more vulnerable. Some critics have chafed at her uniform of bubblegum lampshade dresses and thigh-high boots, with their uneasy mix of sybarite and schoolgirl—as if she were the contrivance of a horny industry Humbert. She is not. “She’s like an R-rated version of a Disney character, super-vivid,” says Pharrell Williams, who produced much of Sweetener and clocked long hours in the studio with Grande pre- and post-Manchester. “But she’s full of self-awareness. That meta-cognition is part of her personality.” To those troubled by her image, Grande has a silencing reply: She just likes it. “I like having my funny character that I play,” she explains, “that feels like this exaggerated version of myself. It protects me. But also I love disrupting it for the sake of my fans and making clear that I’m a person—because that’s something I enjoy fighting for. I can’t help disrupt it. I’m incredibly impulsive and passionate and emotional and just reckless. The music is very personal and very real, but yes, if you can be me for Halloween, if drag queens can dress up as me, then I’m a character. Go to your local drag bar, and you’ll see it. That’s, like, the best thing that’s ever happened to me. It’s better than winning a Grammy.” \nWhile the character has been remarkably consistent across her career, Grande feels it’s only in the last year that she has been able to make the music she has always wanted to make. “There was a two-album period where I was doing half the songs for me and half the songs to solidify my spot in pop music,” she acknowledges. “A lot of my singles have been hilariously lacking in substance. You’re talking to someone who put ‘Side to Side’ out as a single. I love that song, but it’s just a fun song about sex.” I ask her if it ever feels uncomfortable to gaze out at an audience of thousands of nine-year-old girls while singing a song about having so much coitus that it’s hard to walk straight. “They’re for sure gonna have it. I promise. I promise that your kid’s gonna have sex. So if she asks you what the song’s about, talk about it.” One clever aspect of Thank U, Next is the way it coaxes out your most cynical notions about Grande, then forces you to reevaluate them. Consider the three singles that ruled February: “Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored,” “7 Rings,” and the title track. A song ostensibly about female rivalry is in fact about self-love; a paean to materialism celebrates sisterhood; and what sounds like it will be a haughty diss track turns out to be a reflection on the importance of gratitude and reappraisal.\nIt’s tempting to think of Manchester as the inflection point in Grande’s career, though she shrinks from any narrative about the bombing that might place her at its center. “It’s not my trauma,” she says as tears fill her eyes. “It’s those families’. It’s their losses, and so it’s hard to just let it all out without thinking about them reading this and reopening the memory for them.” She pauses to collect herself. “I’m proud that we were able to raise a lot of money with the intention of giving people a feeling of love or unity, but at the end of the day, it didn’t bring anyone back. Everyone was like, Wow, look at this amazing thing, and I was like, What the fuck are you guys talking about? We did the best we could, but on a totally real level we did nothing. I’m sorry. I have a lot to say that could probably help people that I do want to share, but I have a lot that I still need to process myself and will probably never be ready to talk about. For a long time I didn’t want to talk to anyone about anything, because I didn’t want to think about anything. I kind of just wanted to bury myself in work and not focus on the real stuff, because I couldn’t believe it was real. I loved going back into the studio with Pharrell because he just has this magical outlook on everything. He truly believes that the light is coming. And I’m like, Bruh, is it, though?”\nSINCE MANCHESTER, GRANDE HAS emerged as an outspoken advocate of gun control, singing at last year’s March for Our Lives, organized by the survivors of the Parkland massacre. She flew from Hong Kong to Charlottesville on the last day of her Dangerous Woman tour to perform in A Concert for Charlottesville, a response to the Unite the Right rally. She is passionately pro-LGBTQ and passionately anti–Donald Trump at a time when many of her peers have chosen to remain silent about politics lest they alienate a segment of their fan base. “I would rather sell fewer records and be outspoken about what I think is some fuckery than sell more records and be . . . Switzerland. Am I allowed to say that? I love Switzerland. The fake wokes are waiting to attack!”\nThe studio remains Grande’s safe haven. When Miller died, her friends— Tommy, the singer Victoria Monet, her childhood best friend, Aaron Gross, and others—gathered around her in New York, where she had been living. Somebody pointed out that Jungle City Studios was right around the corner from her apartment. “My friends know how much solace music brings me, so I think it was an all-around, let’s-get-her-there type situation,” she recalls. “But if I’m completely honest, I don’t remember those months of my life because I was so drunk and so sad. I don’t really remember how it started or how it finished, or how all of a sudden there were 10 songs on the board. I think that this is the first album and also the first year of my life where I’m realizing that I can no longer put off spending time with myself, just as me. I’ve been boo’d up my entire adult life. I’ve always had someone to say goodnight to. So Thank U, Next was this moment of self-realization. It was this scary moment of ‘Wow, you have to face all this stuff now. No more distractions. You have to heal all this shit.’ ”\nTOMMY BROWN BELIEVES THAT Thank U, Next is Grande’s inner life set to a trap beat. “We were in that studio to throw paint around,” he recalls. “We weren’t thinking about an album. We were drinking a lot of champagne and, I think, doing a lot of therapy with each other. That album is so real because Ari makes her music in the real time of what’s happening in her life.” When I ask Grande whether it is fair to call Thank U, Next a response to Miller’s death, the tears return, along with the reciprocal apologies. Her characteristic heavy eyeliner, flared upward at the edges in the Maria Callas style, never runs. “It’s just hard to hear it so plainly put,” she says. She has rarely commented on her relationship with Miller and has taken umbrage when the media has sought to define her according to her romantic relationships. But in May 2018, she made an exception in the form of a widely admired clapback after a fan of Miller’s took to Twitter following the rapper’s arrest for drunk driving, suggesting that being spurned by Grande was the cause. Her reply was swift and lacerating: “shaming and blaming a woman for a man’s inability to keep his shit together is a very major problem. let’s please stop doing that.”\n“People don’t see any of the real stuff that happens, so they are loud about what they think happened,” she says now. “They didn’t see the years of work and fighting and trying, or the love and exhaustion. That tweet came from a place of complete defeat, and you have no idea how many times I warned him that that would happen and fought that fight, for how many years of our friendship, of our relationship. You have no idea so you’re not allowed to pull that card, because you don’t fucking know. That’s where that came from.” Grande spent years consumed by worry about Miller. Friends with her during the Dangerous Woman tour recall a woman up at all hours, desperately tracking his whereabouts to ensure he wasn’t on a bender. “It’s pretty all-consuming,” she says of her grief over Miller. “By no means was what we had perfect, but, like, fuck. He was the best person ever, and he didn’t deserve the demons he had. I was the glue for such a long time, and I found myself becoming . . . less and less sticky. The pieces just started to float away.”\nGrande has since backed off from using social media to unload her feelings, instead mainly posting benignly glamorous images of ponytails and photos of her dogs . This is an about-face for a woman who has become actual friends with her fans through Twitter, who has been known to direct-message them bars of music before she has shared them with the folks at her label. “Everyone thinks I’m crazy for doing it, but I care about what they have to say more than I care about what anyone at my label has to say, no offense,” she explains. “This is a me-and-them thing. I’m not taking one of those corny breaks from social media where you’re like, ‘The internet hurts me, I’m leaving, goodbye.’ But I’ve definitely established a new boundary. I don’t want to get myself into some shit.” Joan says that she and her daughter have talked a lot about the maintenance of boundaries lately. Ariana has always been an empath. “She has a way of taking on everyone’s pain,” Joan says. “She functions really beautifully, but when she has to laser herself to those heartbreaking moments, I don’t think she can find anything but tears. Sure, I worry about her, but I always tell her, how you’re feeling right now is perfect.”\nOne of the more puzzling chapters of Grande’s public life was her short-lived engagement to Davidson last year, a kamikaze move made in the haze of her breakup with Miller. Her friends had convinced her to decamp to New York, to escape L.A. and her patterns there. “My friends were like, ‘Come! We’re gonna have a fun summer.’ And then I met Pete, and it was an amazing distraction. It was frivolous and fun and insane and highly unrealistic, and I loved him, and I didn’t know him. I’m like an infant when it comes to real life and this old soul, been-around-the-block-a-million-times artist. I still don’t trust myself with the life stuff.”\nArt is made richer through experience, of course, and Grande has never made better art—or sold more records—than when she decided to make music out of the bitter history of the last two years. But it’s nice to get away from oneself now and then: She is currently writing and producing the soundtrack to the upcoming film reboot of Charlie’s Angels, will costar in Ryan Murphy’s Netflix adaptation of the Broadway musical The Prom—and there’s a big acting job she’s hoping to land, though she doesn’t want to jinx it.\n“I have this idea of what I’d like to be,” she says. “I can see this stronger, amazing, fearless version of myself that one day I hope to evolve into. Sometimes I try to be that for my fans before I actually am that myself. I think I’ve been avoiding putting in the work. You know how that gets: You push your therapist away at some point, but then you have to get back to it.” She musters a laugh. “Do you know a good therapist?”",

      "There is nothing more infectious than the joy and love that the LGBTQ community exudes. I grew up with a gay brother whose every move I would emulate. I idolized him. Everything Frankie did, I would do. I can’t remember a difference between Frankie before he came out and Frankie after he came out. He’s always just been Frankie. Sexuality and gender were never topics my family and I were afraid to discuss. When Frankie came out my surprisingly unfazed grandfather said “Congrats! Can we go to dinner now? I’m fuckin hungry.”\nI was taught to do my makeup by queens in gay bars in New York City. I made my Broadway debut at 14 years old and did 8 shows a week but there was never a night I was too tired to run to a gay bar and do a quick Whitney cover before bed.\nMy music being embraced and celebrated by the LGBTQ community is all I ever truly cared about when I thought about my career goals early on. There’s no award I could win or accolade I could receive that would fulfill me more than seeing a 6-foot queen with a 4-foot ponytail walk into my meet n greet and say “hey girl” or meeting a young queer person at Starbucks and them letting me know that my music has helped them become who they are. Literally nothing.\nLove is like music. It knows no boundaries and isn’t exclusive to any one gender, sexuality, race, religion, age or creed. It’s a freedom and a delicious luxury that all people should be able to sink into and enjoy every moment of.\nI am eternally indebted to and inspired by the LGBTQ community. I hope to create anthems for you that wrap you up with comfort and make you get your best life for as long as I live. Thank you for celebrating me the way I celebrate you.\nI love you forever.",

      "Being empowered...... is not the same as being a bitch...\nHAVING SOMETHING TO SAY...... is not the same as HAVING A BAD ATTITUDE....\nwhat I meant when I said what I said about not being Seans ex is that I am tired of living in a world where women are mostly referred to as a mans past, present or future PROPERTY / POSSESSION. I... do not. belong. to anyone. but myself. and neither do you.\nI have clearly not been having the boy questions in my interviews lately because I have come to the realization that I have SO. MUCH. MORE. to talk about. Im currently making the best music Ive ever made in my life, having the best time of my life on tour with some of the greatest people Ive ever known, working my ass off every single day, performing / creating for my babes and getting the chance to meet and hug my babes all over the world every day.\nI come from a long bloodline of female activists. my aunt Judy was the first Italian american female president of the national press club in Washington DC. I think she would have been proud of me for speaking up about something that has been bothering me personally for so long.\nGloria Steinem published an article in 1969 titled After Black Power, Womens Liberation.... and 46 years later... were still not quite there yet!\nIf a women has a lot of sex .... shes a slut.\nIf a man has sex..... HES. A. STUD. a BOSSSSSS. a KING.\nIf a woman even TALKS about sex openly.... she is shamed!\nBut if a man talks or RAPS freely about all the women hes had... he is regaled.\nIf a woman is seen with a friend with a penis, there is an immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled!!\nIf a man is seen with a woman... his status is elevated / celebrated. AWW SHIIIT HE SMASHED!!!1!!1!.\nI know yall already know this but the double standard and misogyny are still ever present.\nI cant wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who theyre dating / married to / attached to, having sex with / seen with.... but by their value as an individual.\nI want the people reading this to know that they are MORE THAN enough on their own.\nI want the media to please help me with this!!!!!!!!! Please support each other.\nIm saying this after literally 8 years of feeling like I constantly had to have a boy by my side. After being on my own now for a few months I am realizing that thats just not the case.... I have never felt more present, grounded, and satisfied. Ive never laughed harder or had more fun or enjoyed my life more.\nOne more thought.... my honeymoon diaries are my way of sharing absolutely as much as I can with my fans. that is something I have done since day one and never plan on changing. it is a safe environment for me to be myself and share funny, special, personal things with my fans and to laugh about silly things Ive done / things Im going through. I dont plan on monitoring or changing that because there are more eyes on me now than there were before. I love yall with all my heart.... youve accepted and celebrated me not only as an artist but as a person since day one and and nothing will change that or change me.\nany woman who chooses to behave like a full human being should be warned that the armies of the status quo will treat her as something of a dirty joke.. She will need her sisterhood. - Gloria Steinem",

      "Through just about the craziest storms and whirlwinds I can imagine, Ariana Grande remains the most real person I’ve met. I’ve always thought the world is privy to actual, genuine emotion—be it heartbreak, empathy, generosity, resilience, strength—and I believe that’s exactly why the world keeps falling deeper in love with Ariana. Wearing her heart on her sleeve and in her work, she oozes those emotions in abundance. Armed with a full comprehension of how the world consumes music today, she is an industry game changer. Having released not one but two critically acclaimed, record-breaking albums just a few months apart—the latter, Thank U, Next, was written in just a few weeks—Ari is breaking the rules and is a force who understands how music should work in 2019. Her love of her fans and of music guide her every move. But my favorite moments with Ari are the quieter ones. When I, like so many, have been inspired by that resilience, love, care and heart in someone I’m lucky to call my friend.\nNow she’s the biggest artist in the world, and that’s kind of a no-brainer to me. I can’t wait to see what she does next.",
