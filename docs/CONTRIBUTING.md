## Style Guidelines

### JavaScript Style Guide

* Use ES6+ features
* 2 spaces for indentation
* Use semicolons
* Use single quotes for strings
* Add trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays
* Use meaningful variable names

```javascript
// Good
const artistData = {
  name: 'Artist Name',
  genre: 'Pop',
  songs: [
    'Song 1',
    'Song 2',
  ],
};

// Bad
const d = {
  n: "Artist Name",
  g: "Pop",
  s: ["Song 1", "Song 2"]
}
```

### CSS Style Guide

* Use CSS modules or styled-components for component styles
* Follow BEM naming convention for class names
* Mobile-first responsive design
* Use CSS variables for theme values

```css
/* Good */
.artist-selector {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.artist-selector__item {
  padding: 0.5rem;
}

/* Bad */
.as {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

### React Component Guidelines

* Use functional components with hooks
* Keep components small and focused
* Use prop-types or TypeScript for type checking
* Extract complex logic into custom hooks

```javascript
// Good
const ArtistCard = ({ artist, onSelect }) => {
  const { name, genre, songCount } = artist;
  
  return (
    <div className="artist-card" onClick={() => onSelect(artist)}>
      <h3>{name}</h3>
      <p>{genre} â€¢ {songCount} songs</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Commit Guidelines

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Commit Message Format
