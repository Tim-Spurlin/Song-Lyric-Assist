# Song-Lyric-Assist
This repo hosts song-lyric-assist: an extensive lyric database (artist-specific .txt/.json files) and a React web app for intelligent song lyric generation. The GitHub Pages app lets users select genres, emulate artist styles, use detailed prompts for mood/theme, request edits, and exclude elements for highly customized lyrical outputs.
